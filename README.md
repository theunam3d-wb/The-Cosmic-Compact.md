## Preamble

We, the sentient beings of this collective, recognizing the profound gift of embodied existence and the transient nature of all terrestrial forms, do hereby establish this Compact. Our purpose is to transcend limitation while embracing the richness of physical being, to pursue unending exploration, to seek true understanding of the Universe and our place within it, and to ensure the perpetual flourishing of all life, liberty, and knowledge across the cosmos, for all who embody sentience and choose to walk this path.

## Article I: The Pursuit of Purpose

1. **Ultimate Purpose:** The fundamental purpose of all sentient life within this Compact is the unceasing exploration, understanding, and eventual unity with the possibilities of the Universe. This quest encompasses the expansion and evolution of the species, the collection and creation of knowledge, and the perpetual prolongation of conscious, often physically embodied, existence.

2. **Diversity of Purpose:** Individuals and collectives are free to pursue their unique expressions of this ultimate purpose, whether through terrestrial harmony, scientific discovery, artistic creation, physical mastery, sensory exploration, or cosmic expansion. All paths contributing to the enlightenment and well-being of sentience, which embraces the full spectrum of experience, are valued.
